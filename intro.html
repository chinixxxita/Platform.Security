    <h1>🌐 Introduction to Platform Security</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What is Platform Security?</h2>
      <p>
        Platform Security is the practice of protecting the foundation on which digital systems run.
        Think of it as building a strong base for a house—if the base is weak, the entire structure becomes unstable. 
        Similarly, if a platform (which includes <strong>hardware, operating systems, and applications</strong>) is not secure,
        everything that runs on it is at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        It applies to <strong>computers, mobile devices, cloud services, IoT devices, and enterprise systems</strong>, 
        using tools and policies that stop hackers and unauthorized users from breaking in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why is Platform Security Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Platforms are the <strong>foundation</strong> of every digital service. If attackers compromise the platform, 
        they can gain access to everything built on top of it. This is why securing platforms is critical.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔒 <strong>Data Protection</strong> – Keeps sensitive information safe.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Prevents Downtime</strong> – Avoids service interruptions that affect productivity.</li>
        <li>📜 <strong>Compliance</strong> – Meets laws like <em>GDPR</em> and <em>HIPAA</em>.</li>
        <li>🤝 <strong>User Trust</strong> – Builds confidence among customers and users.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Common Threats to Platforms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware</strong> – Viruses, ransomware, and spyware that damage files or steal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation</strong> – Hackers gaining unauthorized admin-level access.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-Day Exploits</strong> – Attacks that use unpatched vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rootkits</strong> – Malicious programs that hide deep inside the OS.</li>
        <li><strong>Firmware Attacks</strong> – Targeting BIOS/UEFI or drivers at the hardware level.</li>
        <li><strong>Insider Threats</strong> – Employees or insiders misusing their access rights.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Layers of Platform Security</h2>
      <p>Strong security works in layers, like a fortress with multiple walls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Security</strong> – Protecting hardware from theft or tampering.</li>
        <li><strong>Firmware & Boot Security</strong> – Secure boot processes, BIOS/UEFI passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating System Security</strong> – Regular updates, patches, and privilege control.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Security</strong> – Sandboxing, code signing, and app permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Security</strong> – Firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Security</strong> – Encrypting data both at rest and in transit.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The CIA Triad</h2>
      <p>The <strong>CIA Triad</strong> is the foundation of information security: <em>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</em>.</p>
      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>Only authorized people can access sensitive data like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PII</strong> (Personal Identifiable Information)</li>
        <li><strong>PHI</strong> (Protected Health Information)</li>
        <li><strong>Trade secrets & classified info</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Integrity</h3>
      <p>Ensures data and systems are accurate, whole, and unaltered without permission.</p>
      <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>Authorized users must have timely and reliable access to information and services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Authentication</h2>
      <p>Authentication verifies identity. It can be based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Something you know</strong> – passwords, PINs</li>
        <li><strong>Something you have</strong> – tokens, cards, authentication apps</li>
        <li><strong>Something you are</strong> – biometrics like fingerprints or facial recognition</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Types of Authentication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)</strong> – one method only (e.g., password).</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> – two or more methods combined.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Non-Repudiation</h2>
      <p>Non-Repudiation security principle that ensures a person or entity cannot deny having performed a specific action,
         such as sending a message, signing a document, or making a transaction.

In simple terms, it provides proof of origin and proof of delivery, 
so that neither the sender nor the receiver can later claim “I didn’t send it” or “I never received it.”</p>
     <h2>🔑 Key points about Non-repudiation:</h2>
        <ul> 
         <li>  prevents denial of actions or commitments.</li>
           <li> Commonly used in digital signatures, online banking, e-commerce, and legal agreements.</li>
            <li> Achieved through cryptographic methods like digital signatures, public key infrastructure (PKI), and audit logs.</li>
              </ul>
<p>Example: If you sign a contract electronically using a digital signature,
 you cannot later deny signing it because the system has cryptographic proof tied uniquely to you.</p>
      <p>
        Non-repudiation ensures that people cannot deny their actions, such as sending an email, making a transaction, or signing a document. 
        It provides <span class="highlight">proof and accountability</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is the individual’s right to control how their personal information is collected and shared.  
        For example, the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> in Europe ensures organizations handle data responsibly.
      </p>
      <h2>🔑 Key points about Privacy:</h2>
      <ul> 
      <li>Protects personal and sensitive data from unauthorized access.</li>
      <li>Ensures that users know what information is being collected and why.</li>
      <li>Often supported by laws and regulations (like GDPR, Data Privacy Act of 2012 in PH, HIPAA for health data).</li>
      <li>Maintains trust between users and organizations.</li>
       </ul>
<p> Example: When you shop online, the website must protect your credit card info and not sell your personal data without consent.

👉 In short, privacy = <strong>personal information safe and giving people control over it.</strong>  </p>
    </div>

    <h1>🛡️ Risk Management in Security</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Information Security Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Refers to possible negative outcomes if sensitive data or systems are exposed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized users.
      </p>
      <p>Information Security Risk is<strong>  the potential for loss or damage </strong>to an organization’s information assets 
        (data, systems, networks) due to <strong>threats exploiting vulnerabilities</strong>
In short, it’s about asking:
👉 “What could go wrong with our information, how likely is it, and how bad would it be?”</p>

<h2>🔑 Key Points:</h2>
<ul> 
               <h4><li>Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact</li></h4>             

                 <li> Threat – anything that can cause harm (e.g., hackers, malware, natural disasters).</li>

        <li> Vulnerability – a weakness in the system (e.g., weak passwords, outdated software).</li>

        <li> Impact – the damage caused if the threat succeeds (e.g., data loss, financial cost, reputational damage).</li>

          <h5> <li> Examples of Information Security Risks:</li></h5>

                     <li> Data breach exposing customer information.</li>

          <li> Ransomware attack locking critical files.</li>

     <li> Insider threat (employee misusing data).</li>

           <li> Phishing attacks leading to credential theft.</li>

<li> Physical risks like stolen laptops or server damage.</li>

<h5> <li>Managing Information Security Risks:</li></h5> 

<li>Identify risks (risk assessment).</li>

<li>Evaluate likelihood & impact.</li>

<li>Apply controls (firewalls, encryption, policies, training).</li>

<li>Monitor & review regularly.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Key Terms in Risk Management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asset</strong> – Anything valuable (data, devices, reputation).</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability</strong> – A weakness or gap in security (e.g., outdated software).</li>
        <li><strong>Threat</strong> – Someone or something that exploits vulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong>  
        A wallet is an <strong>asset</strong>. Being distracted is a <strong>vulnerability</strong>.  
        A pickpocket is the <strong>threat</strong>, and their method (like bumping into you) is the <strong>threat vector</strong>.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Threat Actors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insiders</strong> – Employees who act carelessly or maliciously.</li>
        <li><strong>Outsiders</strong> – Hackers or opportunists.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybercriminals & Competitors</strong> – Motivated by money or advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Entities</strong> – Terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists.</li>
        <li><strong>Spies & Intelligence Gatherers</strong> – Collecting sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> – Automated bots or malicious AI.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p>
        Flaws or weaknesses in software, hardware, or processes that attackers can exploit. 
        Even small oversights—like weak passwords—can create big risks.
      </p>
      <p>Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system, network, 
        software, or process that attackers can exploit to cause harm or gain unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>They are like “<strong> open doors or cracks</strong>” in security that make it easier for threats to succeed.</p>
        <h4>🔑 Key Points about Vulnerabilities:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>They don’t cause harm on their own — but when combined with a threat, they create risk.</li>
           <li>Can exist in technology, people, or processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>🛠 Types of Vulnerabilities:</h4>
        <h5>1. Technical Vulnerabilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Software bugs (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection).</li>
          <li>Weak or outdated encryption.</li>
          <li>Unpatched operating systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>2. Configuration Vulnerabilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Default passwords left unchanged.</li>
          <li>Misconfigured firewalls or cloud storage.</li>
          <li>Open network ports not secured.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.  Human Vulnerabilities</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> Weak or reused passwords.</li>
          <li> Falling for phishing scams.</li>
          <li>Lack of security awareness/training</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>4.   Physical Vulnerabilities </h5>
        <ul>
          <li> Unlocked server rooms.</li>
          <li> Lost or stolen devices.</li>
          <li>No backup in case of disaster.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Simple Example:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li>If a website doesn’t sanitize user input → vulnerability.</li> 
        <li>Hacker uses SQL injection to steal data → threat exploiting vulnerability. </li> 
        </ul>
 
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Risk Assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to information, systems, and assets, so organizations can decide how to manage or reduce them.
It’s basically asking:
 “What can go wrong, how likely is it, how bad will it be, and what should we do about it?”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Risk Treatment</h2>
      <p>Ways to handle risks include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong> – Removing the risk entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance</strong> – Accepting low-impact risks without action.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitigation</strong> – Reducing the chance or impact of the risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Transference</strong> – Passing the risk to another party (e.g., insurance).</li>
      </ul>
